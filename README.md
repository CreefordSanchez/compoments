## 📘 React Components Introduction Project
This is a basic React web page built as an introduction to components and props. The purpose of the assignment is to help you understand how to break down a web interface into reusable parts and pass data/styling into them using properties.
<br>
You’ll build and style a small site consisting of four main sections: a header, a hero banner, a gallery, and a footer. Each is represented by a React component and styled using custom CSS.

##🧱 Components Overview
🧭 Header
Displays the website’s title and a basic navigation menu.

<br><br><br>
Shows how layout and structure can be split into a top-level reusable component.

<br><br><br>
🎯 Hero Banner
Contains a main title, some descriptive text, and two action buttons.

The button styles and text are passed in via props, allowing flexibility.

Two types of buttons are supported:

Primary – Solid background color with white text.

Secondary – Transparent background with colored text and border.

<br><br><br>
📚 Gallery
Displays a row of 4 items (e.g., books or images).

Receives an array of image URLs as props from the parent component.

Uses the map() function to dynamically render each image.

<br><br><br>
🧾 Footer
A simple footer element to close the page.

Reinforces the idea of component reuse and separation of concerns.
